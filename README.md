## 💡 What is SafeBet?

**SafeBet** is a **lossless prediction market** where users can bet on crypto price outcomes **without ever losing their money**.  
All user funds are deposited into **Aave** to earn yield while the market is live.  
When the market resolves using **Pyth’s real-time price feeds**, only the **interest** generated is distributed to the winners — while **everyone gets their initial USDC back**.

It’s **risk-free, transparent, and yield-powered speculation** built on DeFi.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Admin creates a market** (e.g., “Will ETH ≥ $3,000 on Oct 30?”)  
2. **Users place bets** in USDC (Yes/No)  
3. The contract deposits all funds into **Aave** to earn interest  
4. **Pyth** provides verified price data to resolve the market  
5. Winners share the **interest earned**, and everyone gets their **principal back**
